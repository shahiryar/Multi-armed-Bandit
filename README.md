# Reinforcement Learning

This is a repository for exploring Reinforcement Learning algorithms and applications. Currently, the repository includes a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the Multi-armed Bandit problem, a classic Reinforcement Learning problem that involves balancing exploration and exploitation.

## Multi-armed Bandit Problem

The Multi-armed Bandit problem involves making a trade-off between exploration and exploitation when selecting from multiple options (arms) with different reward distributions. The notebook in this repository demonstrates the problem and introduces the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm as a solution.

## Strategies for Multi-armed Bandit Problem

In the future, we plan to explore various strategies for solving the Multi-armed Bandit problem, including:

- Epsilon-Greedy algorithm
- Thompson Sampling
- Bayesian Bandits
- Gradient Bandit algorithms

Each strategy will be implemented and compared to the UCB algorithm in terms of performance and complexity.

## Dependencies

The notebook in this repository requires the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Getting Started
